If all columns match, then we use a numeric sort on the row\n			 * positions in the original data array to provide a stable sort.\n			 *\n			 * Note - I know it seems excessive to have two sorting methods, but the first is around\n			 * 15% faster, so the second is only maintained for backwards compatibility with sorting\n			 * methods which do not have a pre-sort formatting function.\n

Each instance of the API class has\n	 * a "context" - i.e. the tables that it will operate on. This could be a single\n	 * table, all tables on a page or a sub-set thereof.\n	 *\n	 * Additionally the API is designed to allow you to easily work with the data in\n	 * the tables, retrieving and manipulating it as required. This is done by\n	 * presenting the API class as an array like interface. The contents of the\n	 * array depend upon the actions requested by each method (for example\n	 * `rows().nodes()` will return an array of nodes, while `rows().data()` will\n	 * return an array of objects or arrays depending upon your table's\n	 * configuration). The API object has a number of array like methods (`push`,\n	 * `pop`, `reverse` etc) as well as additional helper methods (`each`, `pluck`,\n	 * `unique` etc) to assist your working with the data held in a table.\n	 *\n	 * Most methods (those which return an Api instance) are chainable, which means\n	 * the return from a method call also has all of the methods available that the\n	 * top level object had. For example, these two calls are equivalent:\n	 *\n	 *     // Not chained\n	 *     api.row.add( {...} );\n	 *     api.draw();\n	 *\n	 *     // Chained\n	 *     api.row.add( {...} ).draw();\n	 *\n	 * @class DataTable.Api\n	 * @param {array|object|string|jQuery} context DataTable identifier. This is\n	 *   used to define which DataTables enhanced tables this API will operate on.\n	 *   Can be one of:\n	 *\n	 *   * `string` - jQuery selector. Any DataTables' matching the given selector\n	 *     with be found and used.\n	 *   * `node` - `TABLE` node which has already been formed into a DataTable.\n	 *   * `jQuery` - A jQuery object of `TABLE` nodes.\n	 *   * `object` - DataTables settings object\n	 * @param {array} [data] Data to initialise the Api instance with.\n	 *\n	 * @example\n	 *   // Direct initialisation during DataTables construction\n	 *   var api = $('#example').DataTable();\n	 *\n	 * @example\n	 *   // Initialisation using a DataTables jQuery object\n	 *   var api = $('#example').dataTable().api();\n	 *\n	 * @example\n	 *   // Initialisation as a constructor\n	 *   var api = new $.fn.DataTable.Api( 'table.dataTable' );\n

This option defines how that Ajax call is made and where to.\n		 *\n		 * The `ajax` property has three different modes of operation, depending on\n		 * how it is defined. These are:\n		 *\n		 * * `string` - Set the URL from where the data should be loaded from.\n		 * * `object` - Define properties for `jQuery.ajax`.\n		 * * `function` - Custom data get function\n		 *\n		 * `string`\n		 * --------\n		 *\n		 * As a string, the `ajax` property simply defines the URL from which\n		 * DataTables will load data.\n		 *\n		 * `object`\n		 * --------\n		 *\n		 * As an object, the parameters in the object are passed to\n		 * [jQuery.ajax](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) allowing fine control\n		 * of the Ajax request. DataTables has a number of default parameters which\n		 * you can override using this option. Please refer to the jQuery\n		 * documentation for a full description of the options available, although\n		 * the following parameters provide additional options in DataTables or\n		 * require special consideration:\n		 *\n		 * * `data` - As with jQuery, `data` can be provided as an object, but it\n		 *   can also be used as a function to manipulate the data DataTables sends\n		 *   to the server. The function takes a single parameter, an object of\n		 *   parameters with the values that DataTables has readied for sending. An\n		 *   object may be returned which will be merged into the DataTables\n		 *   defaults, or you can add the items to the object that was passed in and\n		 *   not return anything from the function. This supersedes `fnServerParams`\n		 *   from DataTables 1.9-.\n		 *\n		 * * `dataSrc` - By default DataTables will look for the property `data` (or\n		 *   `aaData` for compatibility with DataTables 1.9-) when obtaining data\n		 *   from an Ajax source or for server-side processing - this parameter\n		 *   allows that property to be changed. You can use Javascript dotted\n		 *   object notation to get a data source for multiple levels of nesting, or\n		 *   it my be used as a function. As a function it takes a single parameter,\n		 *   the JSON returned from the server, which can be manipulated as\n		 *   required, with the returned value being that used by DataTables as the\n		 *   data source for the table. This supersedes `sAjaxDataProp` from\n		 *   DataTables 1.9-.\n		 *\n		 * * `success` - Should not be overridden it is used internally in\n		 *   DataTables. To manipulate / transform the data returned by the server\n		 *   use `ajax.dataSrc`, or use `ajax` as a function (see below).\n		 *\n		 * `function`\n		 * ----------\n		 *\n		 * As a function, making the Ajax call is left up to yourself allowing\n		 * complete control of the Ajax request. Indeed, if desired, a method other\n		 * than Ajax could be used to obtain the required data, such as Web storage\n		 * or an AIR database.\n		 *\n		 * The function is given four parameters and no return is required. The\n		 * parameters are:\n		 *\n		 * 1. _object_ - Data to send to the server\n		 * 2. _function_ - Callback function that must be executed when the required\n		 *    data has been obtained. That data should be passed into the callback\n		 *    as the only parameter\n		 * 3. _object_ - DataTables settings object for the table\n		 *\n		 * Note that this supersedes `fnServerData` from DataTables 1.9-.\n		 *\n		 *  @type string|object|function\n		 *  @default null\n		 *\n		 *  @dtopt Option\n		 *  @name DataTable.defaults.ajax\n		 *  @since 1.10.0\n		 *\n		 * @example\n		 *   // Get JSON data from a file via Ajax.\n		 *   // Note DataTables expects data in the form `{ data: [ ...data... ] }` by default).\n		 *   $('#example').dataTable( {\n		 *     "ajax": "data.json"\n		 *   } );\n		 *\n		 * @example\n		 *   // Get JSON data from a file via Ajax, using `dataSrc` to change\n		 *   // `data` to `tableData` (i.e. `{ tableData: [ ...data... ] }`)\n		 *   $('#example').dataTable( {\n		 *     "ajax": {\n		 *       "url": "data.json",\n		 *       "dataSrc": "tableData"\n		 *     }\n		 *   } );\n		 *\n		 * @example\n		 *   // Get JSON data from a file via Ajax, using `dataSrc` to read data\n		 *   // from a plain array rather than an array in an object\n		 *   $('#example').dataTable( {\n		 *     "ajax": {\n		 *       "url": "data.json",\n		 *       "dataSrc": ""\n		 *     }\n		 *   } );\n		 *\n		 * @example\n		 *   // Manipulate the data returned from the server - add a link to data\n		 *   // (note this can, should, be done using `render` for the column - this\n		 *   // is just a simple example of how the data can be manipulated).\n		 *   $('#example').dataTable( {\n		 *     "ajax": {\n		 *       "url": "data.json",\n		 *       "dataSrc": function ( json ) {\n		 *         for ( var i=0, ien=json.length ; i<ien ; i++ ) {\n		 *           json[i][0] = '<a href="/message/'+json[i][0]+'>View message</a>';\n		 *         }\n		 *         return json;\n		 *       }\n		 *     }\n		 *   } );\n		 *\n		 * @example\n		 *   // Add data to the request\n		 *   $('#example').dataTable( {\n		 *     "ajax": {\n		 *       "url": "data.json",\n		 *       "data": function ( d ) {\n		 *         return {\n		 *           "extra_search": $('#extra').val()\n		 *         };\n		 *       }\n		 *     }\n		 *   } );\n		 *\n		 * @example\n		 *   // Send request as POST\n		 *   $('#example').dataTable( {\n		 *     "ajax": {\n		 *       "url": "data.json",\n		 *       "type": "POST"\n		 *     }\n		 *   } );\n		 *\n		 * @example\n		 *   // Get the data from localStorage (could interface with a form for\n		 *   // adding, editing and removing rows).\n		 *   $('#example').dataTable( {\n		 *     "ajax": function (data, callback, settings) {\n		 *       callback(\n		 *         JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem('dataTablesData') )\n		 *       );\n		 *     }\n		 *   } );\n

This is the\n		 *   default that DataTables uses (incrementally increased for each column).\n		 * * `string` - read an object property from the data source. There are\n		 *   three 'special' options that can be used in the string to alter how\n		 *   DataTables reads the data from the source object:\n		 *    * `.` - Dotted Javascript notation. Just as you use a `.` in\n		 *      Javascript to read from nested objects, so to can the options\n		 *      specified in `data`. For example: `browser.version` or\n		 *      `browser.name`. If your object parameter name contains a period, use\n		 *      `\\` to escape it - i.e. `first\\.name`.\n		 *    * `[]` - Array notation. DataTables can automatically combine data\n		 *      from and array source, joining the data with the characters provided\n		 *      between the two brackets. For example: `name[, ]` would provide a\n		 *      comma-space separated list from the source array. If no characters\n		 *      are provided between the brackets, the original array source is\n		 *      returned.\n		 *    * `()` - Function notation. Adding `()` to the end of a parameter will\n		 *      execute a function of the name given. For example: `browser()` for a\n		 *      simple function on the data source, `browser.version()` for a\n		 *      function in a nested property or even `browser().version` to get an\n		 *      object property if the function called returns an object. Note that\n		 *      function notation is recommended for use in `render` rather than\n		 *      `data` as it is much simpler to use as a renderer.\n		 * * `null` - use the original data source for the row rather than plucking\n		 *   data directly from it. This action has effects on two other\n		 *   initialisation options:\n		 *    * `defaultContent` - When null is given as the `data` option and\n		 *      `defaultContent` is specified for the column, the value defined by\n		 *      `defaultContent` will be used for the cell.\n		 *    * `render` - When null is used for the `data` option and the `render`\n		 *      option is specified for the column, the whole data source for the\n		 *      row is used for the renderer.\n		 * * `function` - the function given will be executed whenever DataTables\n		 *   needs to set or get the data for a cell in the column. The function\n		 *   takes three parameters:\n		 *    * Parameters:\n		 *      * `{array|object}` The data source for the row\n		 *      * `{string}` The type call data requested - this will be 'set' when\n		 *        setting data or 'filter', 'display', 'type', 'sort' or undefined\n		 *        when gathering data. Note that when `undefined` is given for the\n		 *        type DataTables expects to get the raw data for the object back<\n		 *      * `{*}` Data to set when the second parameter is 'set'.\n		 *    * Return:\n		 *      * The return value from the function is not required when 'set' is\n		 *        the type of call, but otherwise the return is what will be used\n		 *        for the data requested.\n		 *\n		 * Note that `data` is a getter and setter option.

Like `data`\n		 * this option can be given in a number of different ways to effect its\n		 * behaviour:\n		 *\n		 * * `integer` - treated as an array index for the data source. This is the\n		 *   default that DataTables uses (incrementally increased for each column).\n		 * * `string` - read an object property from the data source. There are\n		 *   three 'special' options that can be used in the string to alter how\n		 *   DataTables reads the data from the source object:\n		 *    * `.` - Dotted Javascript notation. Just as you use a `.` in\n		 *      Javascript to read from nested objects, so to can the options\n		 *      specified in `data`. For example: `browser.version` or\n		 *      `browser.name`. If your object parameter name contains a period, use\n		 *      `\\` to escape it - i.e. `first\\.name`.\n		 *    * `[]` - Array notation. DataTables can automatically combine data\n		 *      from and array source, joining the data with the characters provided\n		 *      between the two brackets. For example: `name[, ]` would provide a\n		 *      comma-space separated list from the source array. If no characters\n		 *      are provided between the brackets, the original array source is\n		 *      returned.\n		 *    * `()` - Function notation. Adding `()` to the end of a parameter will\n		 *      execute a function of the name given. For example: `browser()` for a\n		 *      simple function on the data source, `browser.version()` for a\n		 *      function in a nested property or even `browser().version` to get an\n		 *      object property if the function called returns an object.\n		 * * `object` - use different data for the different data types requested by\n		 *   DataTables ('filter', 'display', 'type' or 'sort'). The property names\n		 *   of the object is the data type the property refers to and the value can\n		 *   defined using an integer, string or function using the same rules as\n		 *   `render` normally does. Note that an `_` option _must_ be specified.\n		 *   This is the default value to use if you haven't specified a value for\n		 *   the data type requested by DataTables.\n		 * * `function` - the function given will be executed whenever DataTables\n		 *   needs to set or get the data for a cell in the column. The function\n		 *   takes three parameters:\n		 *    * Parameters:\n		 *      * {array|object} The data source for the row (based on `data`)\n		 *      * {string} The type call data requested - this will be 'filter',\n		 *        'display', 'type' or 'sort'.\n		 *      * {array|object} The full data source for the row (not based on\n		 *        `data`)\n		 *    * Return:\n		 *      * The return value from the function is what will be used for the\n		 *        data requested.\n		 *\n		 *  @type string|int|function|object|null\n		 *  @default null Use the data source value.\n		 *\n		 *  @name DataTable.defaults.column.render\n		 *  @dtopt Columns\n		 *\n		 *  @example\n		 *    // Create a comma separated list from an array of objects\n		 *    $(document).ready( function() {\n		 *      $('#example').dataTable( {\n		 *        "ajaxSource": "sources/deep.txt",\n		 *        "columns": [\n		 *          { "data": "engine" },\n		 *          { "data": "browser" },\n		 *          {\n		 *            "data": "platform",\n		 *            "render": "[, ].name"\n		 *          }\n		 *        ]\n		 *      } );\n		 *    } );\n		 *\n		 *  @example\n		 *    // Execute a function to obtain data\n		 *    $(document).ready( function() {\n		 *      $('#example').dataTable( {\n		 *        "columnDefs": [ {\n		 *          "targets": [ 0 ],\n		 *          "data": null, // Use the full data source object for the renderer's source\n		 *          "render": "browserName()"\n		 *        } ]\n		 *      } );\n		 *    } );\n		 *\n		 *  @example\n		 *    // As an object, extracting different data for the different types\n		 *    // This would be used with a data source such as:\n		 *    //   { "phone": 5552368, "phone_filter": "5552368 555-2368", "phone_display": "555-2368" }\n		 *    // Here the `phone` integer is used for sorting and type detection, while `phone_filter`\n		 *    // (which has both forms) is used for filtering for if a user inputs either format, while\n		 *    // the formatted phone number is the one that is shown in the table.\n		 *    $(document).ready( function() {\n		 *      $('#example').dataTable( {\n		 *        "columnDefs": [ {\n		 *          "targets": [ 0 ],\n		 *          "data": null, // Use the full data source object for the renderer's source\n		 *          "render": {\n		 *            "_": "phone",\n		 *            "filter": "phone_filter",\n		 *            "display": "phone_display"\n		 *          }\n		 *        } ]\n		 *      } );\n		 *    } );\n		 *\n		 *  @example\n		 *    // Use as a function to create a link from the data source\n		 *    $(document).ready( function() {\n		 *      $('#example').dataTable( {\n		 *        "columnDefs": [ {\n		 *          "targets": [ 0 ],\n		 *          "data": "download_link",\n		 *          "render": function ( data, type, full ) {\n		 *            return '<a href="'+data+'">Download</a>';\n		 *          }\n		 *        } ]\n		 *      } );\n		 *    } );\n
